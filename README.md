### 🚨 **Quick Incident Reporting**
With just a tap, you can place a "hot point" on the map and alert others. Action is key!

* **Fire 🔥:** Report fires, explosions, or smoke. Plus, you can call the local fire station directly!
* **Car Crash 🚗:** Report car, motorcycle, or pedestrian accidents. Connect with local emergency services and paramedics instantly!
* **Theft 🥷:** For any type of theft, robbery, or burglary (including car theft!). Alert local police with a single tap.
* **Pets 🐶:** A lost or found pet? Mark its location and call animal rescue centers. Help us reunite furry families!
* **Emergency 🆘:** For any urgent situation: medical emergencies, natural disasters, or any other critical event requiring immediate attention.

### 📍 **Add Places to Your Map (and Discover Them)**
Beyond incidents, Harkai allows you to enrich your city's map:

* **Add Points of Interest:** You can contribute by adding businesses, stores, parks, plazas, or shopping malls.
* **Simple Process:** To add a place, a small financial contribution is required, and it's mandatory to upload a photo of the location! 📸
* **Proximity Notifications:** Harkai will notify you when you are near a new or interesting place. Explore your city like never before!

### 🔔 **Stay Always Alert with Smart Notifications**
Your safety is our priority. Harkai sends you real-time alerts about nearby incidents, even when the app is in the background. This is possible thanks to our "always-on location" feature, keeping you protected at all times.
